# stock_game
This is a simple stock game written by c++.It is for me to practice C++. To play this game, you need to enter how days you want play in
this game, and each day you need to guess the market will increase or not and bet it, you can choose whether you bet it with leverage or 
not.If the market is rise,the increase of amount you bet is equals to the percentage increase of the market.Wish you enjoy the game and 
good luck.
